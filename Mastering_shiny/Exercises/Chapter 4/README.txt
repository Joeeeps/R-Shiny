As Chapter 4's exercise scripts required specific data, I thought I would play around with R Shiny instead on mortality datasets.

The data for this script can be found in the 007/rawdata section of mortality testing, as well as another copy of this script (placed this in Chapter 4 just so I don't have an empty folder between 3 and 5!)
